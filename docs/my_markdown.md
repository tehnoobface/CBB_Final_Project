# Our Project

An implementation of original Python pacakge: bracket_package
<!-- ![Figure_1](figure_path) -->

* bracket_package generates playoff brackets and outcomes for the NCAA March Madness Playoff tournament based on a method of prediction.
* Those methods are chosen by the user and include the power ranking, seeding (or rank for 2020 data), or total wins.

With the use of our package we are able to:

1. Compare package's prediction results with actual existing data.
2. Analyze the effectiveness of certain predictors in predicting playoff outcomes.
3. Form predictions for future playoff tournaments.
