# CBB_Final_Project
## By: Kayla Tansiongco and Maclean Sherren

## Presentation Outline:
Goal: Make predictions for 2020 post-season based on different columns: W/L Ratio, BARTHAG (powerranking statistic), and Rank

> -Start by presenting the data, note columns and differences between 2020 and the rest of the data, introduce Goal
> -Show how we merged the data, present initial EDA
> -Create playoff bracket
>> -If possible, make the methods of prediction simulate the playoff bracket (run outcomes of each game one at a time)
>> -This could be what the python package we make does; Takes bracket and prediction method as inputs and generates a table or bracket of results as an output.
> -Introduce different methods of prediction (3 total methds)
> -Show results of each method
> -Other potential for python package: combines each method and with equal weight to determine overall outcome
>> -Assign weight to different methods based on Std. Error
> -Show results, discuss outcomes, and potential draw backs or other methods of prediction not included in our Presentation
